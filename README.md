# IITNews App
# This was a project in CS442 Mobile App Development at The Illinois Institute of Technology. 
# This app pulls JSON data from a news source API to show real time news sources that can be filtered out through menu items of categories, languages, and countries. A drawer layout is then used to select the desired news source. ViewPager layout is used to swipe between the source's top 10 news articles. Clicking on a news article takes the user to the article on the news source website.
